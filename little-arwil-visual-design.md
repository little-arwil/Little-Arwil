# Little Arwil Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A warm, authentic, and approachable visual identity that balances childhood innocence with parental pragmatism. The aesthetic draws inspiration from the clean, lifestyle-focused storytelling of Kinfolk magazine, combined with the simple, functional design philosophy of brands like Muji. The core idea is to build trust through a sense of quiet quality and genuine care, reflecting the brand's rational and no-gimmick approach.

### Content Density

Medium density. The design prioritizes visual storytelling and emotional connection. Each section will feature large, authentic imagery with concise, impactful copy, using generous white space (around 20-25%) to create a clean, premium, and trustworthy feel.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #F8F5F2 (Warm off-white, creating a soft, natural canvas)
- Primary color: #A8B3A0 (Sage green, representing natural comfort and trust)
- Secondary color: #DCD3C5 (Soft taupe, adding warmth and sophistication)
- Accent color: #E29A72 (Warm terracotta, bringing energy and approachability)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #4D463F (Warm charcoal, easy on the eyes)
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #F8F5F2 (Matching background for consistency)

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Oranienbaum (A modern serif with elegant lines, conveying quiet quality and trust)
  - Unna (A neoclassical serif with gentle strength, adding a touch of refined warmth)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A classic, warm sans-serif that is highly readable and friendly)
  - Sorts Mill Goudy (A classic serif with a gentle feel, perfect for storytelling and authenticity)

## 4. Image Style

Focus on authentic, soft-focus lifestyle photography. Capture candid moments of children playing comfortably in natural light, emphasizing texture and warmth. Product shots should be clean and minimal, while brand imagery should feel like a calm, intimate documentary, avoiding overly posed or artificial scenes.
